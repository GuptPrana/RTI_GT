# Camera-based Ground Truth for Supervised Learning in Radio Tomography.

Key Ideas:
- Super-resolution - To distinguish seperate objects close to each other
- Object Shape Definition - To learn exact shape of objects
- Node Reduction - Fewer Nodes
- 3D Reconstruction - Multi-splice model
- Time-series - For object recognition and tracking

Camera Setup: Intel Realsense D435F or D455
